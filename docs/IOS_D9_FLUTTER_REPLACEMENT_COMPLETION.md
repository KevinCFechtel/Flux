# iOS D9 — Flutter Replacement Completion / Legacy-Parity Closure

> **Status: IN PROGRESS — FINAL NATIVE REPLACEMENT COMPLETION GATE**
>
> Decision date: 26 September 2026.
>
> `docs/PHASE_D_NATIVE_IOS_IPADOS.md` remains the authoritative Phase-D
> roadmap. This document records the final product decisions from the
> repository-first FluxNews-to-native gap audit. D9 is not a general Flutter
> parity project: only the explicitly retained capabilities below are required.
> Items explicitly retired or replaced here must not later be reintroduced as
> accidental "parity gaps" without a new product decision.

## 1. Purpose

D1-D7 establish the native architecture and system integrations. D8 is not
required for the replacement release. D9 closes the remaining user-visible and
upgrade/release gaps required to replace the production Flutter iOS/iPadOS app
with the native client.

D9 must preserve the frozen Rust/Core ownership, UIKit Timeline architecture,
D5 background/notification ownership, D6 media runtime, and D7 system-media /
CarPlay ownership. Additive settings or WidgetKit configuration must reuse those
boundaries rather than create parallel state owners.

## D9 implementation progress

Current repository status:

- **D9-A — Production Flutter-to-native migration:** COMPLETE / TEST-GATED
- **D9-B — Config Backup and Restore:** OPEN
- **D9-C — Configurable Bottom Action Bar:** COMPLETE / TEST-GATED
- **D9-D — Localization parity:** OPEN
- **D9-E — Downloaded Data:** COMPLETE / TEST-GATED
- **D9-F — Miniflux account information / HTTP warning:** COMPLETE / TEST-GATED
- **D9-G — Open Source and About:** COMPLETE / TEST-GATED
- **D9-H — Logging & Support Diagnostics:** COMPLETE / TEST-GATED
- **D9 Widget Configuration:** COMPLETE / TEST-GATED
- **Final physical-device Flutter-to-native production-upgrade acceptance:** OPEN

Completed blocks remain subject to the final D9 acceptance gate and regression
suite; their implementation contracts are frozen unless a concrete regression
or new product decision requires reopening them.

## 2. D9 release-critical replacement gates

### D9-A — Production Flutter-to-native migration

Complete the production-identity migration coordinator over the already-defined
copy/import-only migration contract.

Required retained state remains limited to semantically compatible,
non-reconstructable state such as account association/credentials, custom HTTP
headers, compatible Core/native settings, compatible feed preferences, media
policies, playback progress, and valid downloaded-media association.

Flutter's sync-triggered `autoDownloadAudioAfterSync` implementation is not
ported. Its persisted user preference is semantically migrated to Core
`autoDownloadListeningList`: native continues to download only when an article
enters Listening List.

The migration remains idempotent, restart-safe, and non-destructive to legacy
storage. Existing valid native/Core state wins.

The global Flutter secure-storage booleans `markAsReadOnScrollOver` and
`removeNewsFromListWhenRead` migrate to the corresponding native UserDefaults
keys only when those native keys are absent. Both exact Flutter strings `true`
and `false` are stored choices. Native presence, including false, wins.
`sortOrder` remains transient native article-list control state and is not
migrated. `brightnessMode` is replaced by system-native Appearance and is not
migrated.

The versioned D9-A settings follow-up additionally imports exact valid Flutter
values only when the corresponding native setting has no explicit presence:

- `multilineAppBarText` -> Show Article Count;
- `showOnlyFeedCategoriesWithNewNews` -> Hide Empty Navigation Entries;
- `tabAction=expand` -> Reader/Open Detail View. `open` and `splitted` are not
  written;
- Flutter Slidable actions map right/second-right to Leading Full/Additional
  and left/second-left to Trailing Full/Additional. Only equivalent actions are
  imported and each native slot wins independently;
- `startupCategorie` maps All, Bookmarks, Category and Feed by Miniflux ID.
  Category/Feed imports wait for the authoritative catalog rather than using a
  title or URL heuristic;
- `backgroundSyncIntervalMinutes` maps only disabled/enabled, not Flutter's
  interval policy; native D5 scheduling remains authoritative;
- `autoDownloadAudioAfterSync` maps to `autoDownloadListeningList` as above.

`syncReadStatusImmediately` is intentionally not migrated. Flutter's setting
controls only read-status timing, while native `DeliveryMode` governs several
article mutations and is not semantically equivalent.

For the Flutter `feedSettingsOverrides` secure-storage JSON object, D9 migrates
only a positive `openMinifluxEntry: 1` under its numeric Miniflux feed ID to the
existing Core `open_in_miniflux` preference. Flutter serialized zero-valued
defaults for every override field, so `0`, missing, or malformed values are not
evidence of an explicit false choice and are not migrated. The Core retains
field-level native preference presence; an existing native decision, including
explicit false, wins. A positive record for a feed not yet present after account
migration remains retryable until a later successful reconciliation.

### D9-B — Config Backup and Restore on iOS/iPadOS

Expose the existing Flux Config Backup contract through native iOS Settings:

- password-encrypted export;
- native file/share presentation;
- import/restore with validation and explicit failure presentation;
- safe account/Core replacement and widget/cache invalidation according to the
  existing architecture contract.

This is configuration backup, not article/media backup.

### D9-C — Configurable Bottom Action Bar

Restore the useful iOS toolbar configurability from FluxNews using semantic
native actions rather than persisted SwiftUI control identities.

**Sync** is fixed as the leading direct action and is not part of the persisted
user selection. **More** is fixed as the trailing fallback and is always
available.

The configurable priority list contains:

- Filter and Sort;
- direct All/Unread toggle;
- direct sort-order toggle;
- Search;
- Mark All as Read;
- Mark All as Read and Continue;
- Listening List;
- Now Playing;
- Settings.

The persisted order is the priority for direct presentation. Each adaptive
chrome mode exposes a bounded number of configurable direct actions; selected
actions that do not fit move into **More**. Relevant configurable actions that
the user did not select for direct presentation also remain available under
**More**. Contextually invalid actions are omitted rather than shown disabled:
Now Playing requires active loaded media, Mark All as Read is limited to article
scopes that support it, and Mark All as Read and Continue additionally requires
a following visible feed/category scope.

Action Bar Settings use an explicit Edit mode: selected actions may only be
removed or reordered while Edit is active. Adding an available action remains a
normal non-editing operation. Sync and More are shown as fixed explanatory
rows, not removable/reorderable selections.

The Flutter production migration consumes `iosToolbarActions` together with
`iosToolbarActionOrder` and maps semantic actions to the native priority list.
Existing native `articleListActionIDs` presence wins, including an explicitly
empty native selection.

Configuration must preserve the existing adaptive placement rules for iPhone
portrait, compact landscape, regular split presentation, and system
vertical-toolbar environments.

### D9-D — Localization parity required for replacement

The native iOS/iPadOS app must restore the production FluxNews language set:

- English;
- German;
- Spanish;
- Galician;
- Dutch;
- Tamil;
- Turkish.

Localization remains native and Weblate-managed. This does not require carrying
forward obsolete Flutter-only strings or settings.

## 3. D9 Settings completion

### D9-E — Downloaded Data

Add a normal Settings destination for downloaded media storage.

Required information/actions:

- downloaded audio item/file count;
- total local downloaded-media storage size;
- destructive **Delete All Downloads** action with confirmation;
- refresh after transfer/deletion changes.

This is a storage-management surface over the existing D6/Core download model.
It must not create a second downloads library or duplicate Listening List state.

Implementation contract:

- Core owns the aggregate downloaded-media summary and bulk transition to
  `DeleteRequested`;
- `Downloaded` and `DeleteRequested` rows with a local file remain part of
  the storage summary until native deletion is acknowledged;
- iOS never deletes these files directly from Settings and instead reuses the
  D6 transfer/deletion reconciliation path;
- media currently protected by active playback remains deferred by the existing
  D6 deletion guard;
- Listening List membership and playback progress are not cleared by this
  action.

### D9-F — Miniflux account information and transport warning

Account/Settings must additionally expose:

- the detected Miniflux server version when available;
- a visible warning when the configured Miniflux server uses unencrypted
  `http://` rather than HTTPS.

HTTP remains supported where the existing account validation permits it; the
warning informs the user rather than changing transport ownership.

Implementation contract:

- the successfully detected Miniflux version is retained as non-sensitive,
  account-bound presentation metadata and restored for the same normalized
  server after app restart;
- failed replacement validation/activation does not overwrite the currently
  active account's retained version;
- the HTTP warning is presentation-only and is derived from the currently
  configured/edited server URL;
- failed validation technical information is exposed under **Connection
  Details**, not Developer Diagnostics.

### D9-G — Open Source and About

Settings must provide normal user-facing access to:

- the Flux project/source repository;
- app version/build information;
- About/legal information appropriate for the shipped native app;
- Miniflux/project attribution where retained by the product.

Developer Diagnostics is not a substitute for this normal user-facing
information.

Implementation contract:

- version and build are read from the shipped application bundle rather than a
  second settings-owned version constant;
- the original **FluxNews** repository is linked as the application project's
  long-term repository, because the native project is intended to move there;
- the current **Flux** repository remains linked for the existing native/shared
  Core development history;
- the BSD 3-Clause license and Miniflux project are directly reachable from the
  About surface;
- the retained project identity follows the original FluxNews values where
  still applicable: **Flux News**, Kevin Fechtel attribution, Miniflux project
  attribution and BSD 3-Clause licensing.

### D9-H — Logging & Support Diagnostics

Logging becomes a normal user/support Settings destination rather than a
Developer Diagnostics-only surface.

The existing `IOSAppDiagnostics` / `IOSAppLogger` implementation remains the
single native support-log store. D9 must not introduce a second log database or
duplicate Core/native logging path.

The Settings surface must provide:

- **Debug Logging** toggle using the existing persisted preference;
- current retained record count;
- **Log Viewer**;
- the existing diagnostics export through the native share/file flow;
- destructive **Clear Logs** with confirmation;
- concise privacy/retention explanation.

Normal Info/Warning/Error records remain available without Debug Logging.
Debug/Trace records are retained only while Debug Logging is enabled. Existing
bounded persistence, Core diagnostic bridging, unified logging mirroring, and
credential/custom-header redaction remain authoritative.

The Log Viewer must operate directly on the retained structured
`IOSAppLogEntry` records and provide at least:

- newest-first browsing;
- timestamp, level, category/module and message;
- text search across category and message;
- level filtering for Trace, Debug, Info, Warning and Error plus All;
- refresh/reload;
- copy of an individual record or its visible text.

The existing export remains the support handoff format and continues to include
retained native/Core records together with app version/build, OS version, device
class, Debug Logging state and record count. Export must remain privacy-sanitized.

A legacy **Clear Logs on Start** preference is not restored. The bounded native
support log and explicit Clear Logs action replace that Flutter-era behavior.

Implementation status:

- normal Settings now exposes **Support Diagnostics** backed directly by
  `IOSAppDiagnostics`;
- Debug Logging uses the existing persisted preference and retained record count
  is read from the same bounded store;
- the structured Log Viewer reads `IOSAppLogEntry` records directly, presents
  them newest-first, supports level filtering and Category/Message search,
  reloads on demand, and supports per-record copy;
- diagnostics export continues to use the existing privacy-sanitized support
  handoff and native Share presentation;
- **Clear Logs** requires destructive confirmation and clears only the retained
  support log;
- `DeveloperDiagnosticsView` no longer owns support logging/export controls and
  is reachable from Settings only in DEBUG/performance-diagnostics builds.

### Developer Diagnostics retirement

The current `DeveloperDiagnosticsView` is temporary development scaffolding and
must not remain a normal production Settings destination after D9.

Only the following durable support capability moves out of it:

- the complete Support Diagnostics/logging feature described in D9-H.

The remaining sections do **not** move into normal Settings:

- Rust Core status/smoke-test presentation;
- sandbox paths;
- legacy migration feasibility/probe output;
- Article Image Presentation metrics;
- Article Image Cache metrics;
- Timeline Performance counters/reset/print controls.

Those are development/performance instruments. They may remain compile-time
DEBUG/performance diagnostics where useful, but they are not production product
settings.

One related support affordance already lives outside the Developer Diagnostics
screen and should remain: failed account validation may expose technical
connection details under **Account**. Its user-facing label should be
**Connection Details** (or equivalent), not **Developer Diagnostics**.

Migration failures that require user action belong to the D9-A migration flow
with normal error/retry presentation; the legacy read-only probe itself does not
become a permanent Settings feature.

## 4. D9 Widget configuration extension

The existing D5 WidgetKit architecture remains authoritative: the extension is
credential-free, Core-free, database-free, and network-free and reads only a
versioned App Group snapshot plus bounded icon files.

D9 adds per-widget configuration for:

- **Read filter:** Unread / All;
- **Sort order:** Newest First / Oldest First.

The configured read filter applies inside the selected widget scope. For
Bookmarks, **All** means all starred articles represented by the retained widget
projection and **Unread** means unread starred articles.

The widget snapshot remains bounded. If `WidgetSnapshotV1` cannot correctly
represent both read filters and both sort directions for the supported widget
capacities, D9 must introduce a versioned backward-safe snapshot extension
rather than letting the WidgetKit extension query Core, SQLite, Miniflux, or
credentials directly.

There is intentionally **no widget-specific Open in Miniflux preference**.
Article taps already enter the main app's normal article-open path, which applies
the article/feed routing policy including the existing per-feed **Open in
Miniflux** setting. D9 must preserve that single routing authority.

Implementation contract:

- the original top-level `WidgetSnapshotV1` schema remains readable and keeps
  schema version 1; D9 adds an optional, independently versioned
  `ConfigurationProjectionV1` payload so older extensions ignore the new
  fields and newer extensions continue to decode old D5 snapshots;
- Core's widget read model remains bounded and now retains up to 12 candidates
  from both the newest and oldest end of each feed, with read-state-specific
  candidates as needed for Unread/All, plus bounded newest/oldest bookmark
  candidates;
- Core additionally supplies authoritative All counts globally and per
  feed/category plus unread-bookmark count; the existing unread/bookmark counts
  remain intact;
- the WidgetKit extension still reads only the App Group snapshot and icon files;
  it never opens Core, SQLite, Miniflux, credentials or the network;
- AppIntent configuration exposes Read Filter = Unread/All and Sort Order =
  Newest First/Oldest First per widget instance;
- legacy selections retain their prior defaults (Unread for normal scopes, All
  for Bookmarks). New AppIntent instances use explicit Unread and Newest First
  defaults;
- if a newly configured All/Oldest combination encounters an old D5 snapshot,
  the widget presents a bounded refresh-required state instead of pretending
  that the incomplete candidate set is authoritative.

## 5. Explicitly retired/replaced FluxNews behaviors

The following audited FluxNews behaviors are deliberately **not** D9 work.

### Feed-icon cache clear

No user-facing "Delete Feed Icons Only" control is required. Feed icons remain
regenerable cache and use the native/Core cache lifecycle.

### OLED / True Black

There is no Flux-specific OLED/True-Black toggle. Native iOS/iPadOS should use
system semantic colors, materials, and platform Dark Mode so OLED-capable
devices receive the best native dark appearance available without a separate
Flux setting.

This is an explicit product decision and replaces the legacy
`useBlackMode` preference.

### Legacy headline-placement toggle

The old `showHeadlineOnTop` option is not carried forward. The native article
views and frozen UIKit Timeline own the canonical content ordering/layout.

### Legacy paragraph and attachment-image preferences

The legacy per-feed `preferParagraph` and `preferAttachmentImage` settings
are not carried forward. Current Core/native article processing and image
selection remain authoritative.

### Image-cache duration

There is no user-configurable image-cache age. Native iOS manages the article
image path with bounded decoded-image caching, normal HTTP caching, memory
pressure/eviction, and implementation-owned cache policy. Cache tuning is a
native performance concern, not a product setting.

## 6. D9 acceptance contract

D9 is complete only when:

1. the production-identity Flutter-to-native migration path is validated on a
   physical device without destructive legacy conversion;
2. config backup/export and restore/import complete a tested native round trip;
3. Bottom Action Bar semantic configuration persists and remains correct across
   the existing adaptive iPhone/iPad layouts;
4. EN/DE/ES/GL/NL/TA/TR native localization coverage is present for the
   production UI;
5. Settings exposes downloaded-data count/size and Delete All Downloads;
6. widget instances can independently select Unread/All and
   Newest First/Oldest First while the extension remains Core/DB/network-free;
7. widget article taps continue to use the normal app/per-feed open policy with
   no widget-specific Miniflux destination setting;
8. Settings exposes Miniflux version, insecure-HTTP warning, Open Source, and
   About/version/legal information;
9. Settings exposes Debug Logging, a searchable/filterable structured Log
   Viewer, privacy-sanitized export, retained-record count and confirmed Clear
   Logs using the existing `IOSAppDiagnostics` store;
10. the production Settings hierarchy no longer depends on
    `DeveloperDiagnosticsView`; only normal Account connection details and the
    migrated logging/support surface remain user-facing;
11. no retired legacy toggle listed in this document is reintroduced;
12. the canonical Rust, native iOS and affected shared-Apple/macOS regression
    gates remain green.

After D9 acceptance, no known release-blocking Flutter replacement gap remains
unless a new concrete product or production-upgrade defect is discovered.
