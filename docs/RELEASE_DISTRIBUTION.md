## 1. Goals

Create one coherent release-scripting model across Android, iOS and macOS.

The release layer should:

- expose consistent version/build-number inputs;
- separate local build/test concerns from signed distribution preparation;
- validate package/bundle identifiers, versions, embedded extensions and signing;
- put final artifacts in predictable `dist/` locations;
- fail early on missing signing configuration or identity mismatches;
- be callable locally and from GitHub Actions without duplicating release logic;
- keep secrets, keystores, provisioning material and App Store credentials out of Git;
- allow CI to build release artifacts when useful, without making CI artifact
  publication the primary Apple distribution mechanism.

Platform-specific store requirements remain explicit. "Unified" means a common
interface and ownership model, not one generic script that hides important
differences between Gradle, Xcode, Play, F-Droid and App Store Connect.

## R1 implementation — production-first defaults (17 October 2026)

The existing platform build scripts now default to production **release build configurations**, not debug configurations. Debug/development identities require explicit arguments. This does **not** mean that a normal build publishes to a store, nor that every release-configured artifact is store-signed.

- Android: `android/Build/build-app.sh` defaults to `productionRelease` (APK). Use `developmentDebug` explicitly for debug and `productionBundle <versionCode> <versionName>` for a signed Play AAB.
- iOS: `apple/ios/Build/build-app.sh` defaults to the production-identity `Upgrade Test` configuration; `developmentDebug` selects Debug. `apple/ios/Build/archive.sh` and `export-appstore.sh` default to the production identity; `developmentRelease` remains explicit.
- macOS: `apple/macos/Build/build-app.sh` defaults to the Release configuration; `CONFIGURATION=Debug` opts into debug. `--build-number N --version-name V` overrides the version for normal builds. Its existing `DEVELOPMENT_SIGNING` behavior is unchanged; store-signed distribution uses the separate archive/export scripts.

The shared entry point is now `bash Build/release.sh`. Examples:

```bash
bash Build/release.sh android
bash Build/release.sh android --debug
bash Build/release.sh android --target play --version-code 2026101701 --version-name 3.0.0
bash Build/release.sh ios
bash Build/release.sh ios --target appstore --version-code 3002 --version-name 3.0.0
bash Build/release.sh macos
bash Build/release.sh macos --debug
bash Build/release.sh macos --version-code 3002 --version-name 3.0.0
bash Build/release.sh macos --target appstore --version-code 3002 --version-name 3.0.0
```

The entry point delegates to the existing platform scripts. Apple App Store export creates an IPA for **manual** Transporter upload only. Play produces an AAB without uploading. Version inputs are mandatory for store targets. F-Droid targets intentionally fail until implemented. macOS App Store archive/export is now implemented provisionally and requires real signing/export validation on a Mac.

**R1 is partial:** full output normalization (Play AAB and iOS IPA now use stable `dist/android/play/` and `dist/ios/appstore/` paths), comprehensive signed distribution validation, macOS App Store signing/export validation on a real Mac, and CI orchestration are still to be implemented. `bash Build/test-release-cli.sh` checks argument validation without invoking Gradle or Xcode. Existing scripts' legacy invocation forms are preserved for compatibility. F-Droid-specific release validation remains B2.

## 2. Target command model

Prefer a small repository-level release entry point, for example:

```text
Build/release.sh android play <versionCode> <versionName>
Build/release.sh android fdroid <versionCode> <versionName>
Build/release.sh ios appstore <buildNumber> <versionName>
Build/release.sh macos appstore <buildNumber> <versionName>
```

The exact file name may change during implementation, but the public contract
should remain narrow and consistent:

- platform;
- distribution target;
- build/version;
- optional output directory;
- no implicit publication unless the command explicitly says `publish`.

The top-level script should delegate to platform-owned scripts rather than
embedding Gradle/Xcode behavior itself.

A preferred shape is:

```text
Build/
  release.sh

android/Build/
  build-app.sh
  prepare-play-release.sh
  prepare-fdroid-release.sh
  publish-fdroid.sh

apple/ios/Build/
  build-app.sh
  archive.sh
  export-appstore.sh

apple/macos/Build/
  build-app.sh
  archive.sh
  export-appstore.sh
```

Names are illustrative; implementation should reuse and rename current scripts
only where that genuinely improves consistency.

## 3. Common release contract

All production release paths should accept explicit versions.

### Android

- `versionCode`: positive integer accepted by Android/Play/F-Droid.
- `versionName`: user-visible release version.

### Apple

- `CFBundleVersion`: explicit monotonically increasing build number.
- `CFBundleShortVersionString`: user-visible release version.
- Host app and embedded extensions must use matching versions.

Release scripts must never silently invent a production version when invoked for
store distribution.

All final scripts should print a concise release summary containing:

- platform/distribution target;
- application/bundle ID;
- version;
- build/version code;
- artifact path;
- signing identity/certificate fingerprint where safe and useful;
- whether publication occurred.

## Android release promotion policy (decision: 18 October 2026)

> **Binding release policy; orchestration still to be implemented.** This policy
> applies to Android/FluxNews releases. It does not imply that B2, F-Droid signing
> continuity, the official F-Droid publication, or the new release workflow have
> already passed acceptance.

**Channel ownership and cadence**

- **GitHub Releases** and **F-Droid** follow the latest *approved* FluxNews
  release. New approved releases must not be held back by Google Play review.
  F-Droid's external build/review queue can introduce a delay after submission.
- **Google Play** is a separate, owner-operated distribution channel. The owner
  chooses when to prepare, upload and publish an AAB. Slow Google review must
  not block GitHub Releases, F-Droid submissions or continued development on
  `main`. Do not automate Play submission/publication.
- One source version and immutable release commit identify the approved release.
  It is acceptable for Play to remain on an older published version and skip
  intermediate GitHub/F-Droid releases. All Android version codes must stay
  compatible with Android's monotonic update rules.

**Required promotion sequence — fail closed**

1. Select an Android release candidate: explicit `versionName`,
   `versionCode`, full source commit SHA and candidate release notes. Treat
   the SHA as immutable for this attempt; do not create the *final* release tag
   or publish a GitHub Release yet.
2. Run the common Android/Rust release checks and **one actual F-Droid
   metadata/scanner/source-build gate against that exact SHA**. The gate must
   produce a nonempty unsigned APK and verify the application ID
   `de.circle_dev.flux_news`, versions, and required native architectures
   (`arm64-v8a`, `x86_64`, `armeabi-v7a`). Reject missing, failed, skipped or
   inconclusive mandatory checks. Reuse existing checks and avoid duplicate
   native builds.
3. Before any first native F-Droid publication, also close B2's dependency
   provenance, reproducibility, historical metadata/signature and
   Flutter-to-native signed-update acceptance criteria. CI success alone does
   **not** establish signing/update compatibility.
4. **Only after all required gates succeed for the same SHA**, create the
   immutable version tag on that tested SHA, publish the corresponding GitHub
   Release and its validated artifacts/release notes, and prepare/submit the
   matching F-Droid recipe referencing that exact tag/SHA. F-Droid submission
   must be explicit and separate from build verification.
5. Official F-Droid infrastructure has its own acceptance/build cycle. A
   successful local or GitHub Actions recipe build is required before GitHub
   publication but does **not** guarantee a successful official F-Droid build.
   Track an external failure explicitly; do not silently change the already
   published tag or its source. Resolve it with a newly tested candidate
   (normally the next patch release), preserving traceability.

**When a candidate fails**

- **No GitHub Release, final tag or F-Droid submission** when any mandatory
  gate fails. Fix the cause on a development/release branch, create a new
  commit/SHA, and rerun *all mandatory gates for that new SHA* before promotion.
  Keep development on `main` independent of any pending store review.
- CI must check the exact commit, expected metadata and actual APK content; a
  workflow marked green with `1 build failed`, or without an APK, is a failure.
- Cost-control: build F-Droid on explicit release validation and focused
  F-Droid changes rather than every documentation-only update. Use path-aware
  triggers, reusable jobs, scoped concurrency/cancellation and **one** recipe
  build per candidate where possible. Do not tie Google Play or Apple jobs to
  the F-Droid gate merely for sequencing.

**Google Play release notes**

- The owner may submit a later approved release directly and omit intervening
  GitHub/F-Droid versions. Generate Play-specific release notes as the
  cumulative *user-relevant* changes since the version **last actually
  published on Google Play**, not since the last GitHub release or an
  unapproved Play submission. Review the combined notes manually before
  uploading the selected signed AAB.
- Review delays, replaced submissions and Managed Publishing do not change the
  identity or readiness of the GitHub/F-Droid source release.

**Implementation status (18 October 2026):** PR
[#66](https://github.com/KevinCFechtel/Flux/pull/66) has a successful
[experimental recipe-build run](https://github.com/KevinCFechtel/Flux/actions/runs/39140681750)
for Android 3.0.0 / `2026101801`, including APK identity/ABI validation.
This proves one CI test build, **not** repeatable official F-Droid eligibility,
historic-signing compatibility or implemented release promotion. PR #66
remains separate from this documentation decision.

### Platform-specific version files (decision: 18 October 2026)

The repository records release versions in **one committed file per platform**:

| File | Application | Keys |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Build/versions/android.properties` | Android (GitHub, F-Droid, Play) | `VERSION_NAME`, `BUILD_NUMBER` |
| `Build/versions/ios.properties` | iOS/iPadOS | `VERSION_NAME`, `BUILD_NUMBER` |
| `Build/versions/macos.properties` | macOS (App Store, optional Developer ID) | `VERSION_NAME`, `BUILD_NUMBER` |

`VERSION_NAME` is the marketing version; `BUILD_NUMBER` maps to Android
`versionCode` or Apple `CFBundleVersion`. A platform-specific version
change must be reviewed and committed with the intended source changes.
The files start at the previously shared values, `3.0.0` and
`2026101801`, **without declaring any new release or bumping versions**.
They may diverge later as release cycles become independent.

`bash Build/release.sh <platform>` defaults to that platform's committed
file; explicit `--version-code` and `--version-name` together continue to
override it, preserving the existing CLI contract. A missing/incomplete
platform version file is an error, not permission to fall back silently to
another platform. Internal Gradle/Xcode development fallbacks are **not**
production release-version sources.

The eventual release orchestrator reads and validates the requested
platform file(s), their monotonically compatible build numbers and the exact
candidate SHA. It must **not** generate/auto-increment versions or push
version-bump commits during promotion. For `all` releases it additionally
checks that all three `VERSION_NAME` values match; differing numbers imply
separate platform releases. The F-Droid recipe/versionCode and versionName
must agree with the **Android** file, but historical F-Droid entries and
signing fingerprints remain immutable. Do not introduce multiple manually
maintained version authorities in Gradle, Xcode, F-Droid and Actions.

**Implementation state:** The split and CLI selection are being developed
in [PR #66](https://github.com/KevinCFechtel/Flux/pull/66); orchestration
and automated F-Droid recipe generation remain follow-up work. Documenting
this decision does not authorize any tag, store upload, or F-Droid submission.

## 4. Android — Google Play

The current Android build already has a canonical production bundle path through
`android/Build/build-app.sh productionBundle <versionCode> <versionName>`.

Keep that path as the implementation basis, but normalize it behind the shared
release interface.

The Play preparation step must:

- produce the signed production AAB;
- retain application ID `de.circle_dev.flux_news`;
- require explicit versionCode/versionName;
- validate the configured Play upload signing identity;
- verify the resulting bundle/package metadata;
- write the final AAB to a stable `dist/` location;
- never commit signing properties or keystores.

Uploading to Play Console and releasing there are deliberately manual
owner-controlled actions. This repository must prepare/validate a selected
signed Play AAB without automatically submitting or publishing it. The owner
may skip intervening GitHub/F-Droid versions and use consolidated release notes
relative to the last version actually published on Play; see the Android
release promotion policy above.

## 5. Android — F-Droid

A native F-Droid path is still required.

**Prerequisite:** Complete the reproducible source-build and scanner feasibility gate B2 in [POST_REPLACEMENT_FOLLOWUP_PLAN.md](POST_REPLACEMENT_FOLLOWUP_PLAN.md) before implementing the publication workflow. Pinned Cargo-derived AARs and JNA require provenance/build checks; scanner failure has not yet been established.

The repository must gain both:

1. canonical local F-Droid release preparation; and
2. a GitHub Action that builds and publishes/submits the native F-Droid release
   using the same underlying scripts.

The new F-Droid path must replace the old Flutter-repository distribution
ownership only after the native path is validated.

Requirements:

- preserve the existing F-Droid application/package identity;
- keep F-Droid signing independent from Google Play signing;
- support the architectures accepted for the native release;
- be reproducible and compatible with F-Droid's build constraints;
- avoid hidden network/bootstrap steps that make source builds non-reproducible;
- prepare/update the F-Droid metadata from the native `Flux` repository;
- validate a signed in-place update over the existing Flutter F-Droid variant;
- retain old Flutter F-Droid metadata/releases until native update compatibility
  is proven;
- make secrets/signing inputs GitHub Actions secrets or local ignored files,
  never repository content.

### F-Droid GitHub Actions

Add a dedicated workflow, for example
`.github/workflows/fdroid.yml`.

It should have two clearly separated responsibilities:

- **build/verify:** reproducible native F-Droid artifact + metadata validation;
- **publish/submit:** explicit release/manual/tag-triggered submission step after
  build/verify succeeds.

Do not make every push to `main` publish an F-Droid release. The
F-Droid recipe/source-build job is a **required, blocking pre-release gate**
for GitHub publication, not a best-effort post-release check. Its workflow must
allow explicit candidate-SHA validation *before* the final tag exists.

Prefer `workflow_dispatch` and/or deliberate release-candidate triggering
with explicit version inputs, a fixed commit SHA and a reusable build/verify
job. Publishing/submitting the F-Droid recipe is a separate explicit action
**after** promotion of the previously validated SHA. No GitHub Release or tag
may be created first and then retroactively "validated".

The Action must call repository scripts. It must not contain a second independent
implementation of signing, versioning or packaging logic in YAML.

## 6. iOS — App Store Connect / Transporter

The primary iOS distribution remains the App Store.

Current building blocks already exist:

- `apple/ios/Build/build-app.sh`;
- `apple/ios/Build/archive.sh`;
- `apple/ios/Build/export-appstore.sh`.

These should be normalized into the common release model.

The final iOS App Store release path should:

- build the production configuration;
- archive the app;
- validate the production bundle identifier;
- validate the Widget extension identifier;
- validate App Group entitlements;
- validate host/extension version equality;
- export an App Store Connect-compatible IPA;
- place it in a predictable `dist/` directory;
- clearly report that the IPA is ready for Transporter/manual App Store Connect
  upload.

Rename `export-appstore.sh` to a more accurate App Store-oriented name if the
implementation confirms that it is a general `app-store-connect` export rather
than TestFlight-specific behavior. Preserve compatibility temporarily if other
automation already calls the old name.

### iOS CI artifact builds

GitHub Actions may optionally create unsigned or appropriately signed release
artifacts for verification/download when credentials are available.

That is supplementary. The primary production-distribution workflow should
remain:

```text
local/canonical release script
→ signed Xcode archive
→ validated App Store Connect IPA
→ Transporter/App Store Connect
→ TestFlight/App Store release
```

CI should never require storing broad Apple developer credentials merely to
replace a reliable Transporter-based release process.

## 7. macOS — App Store Connect / Transporter

**Implementation/acceptance distinction (16 October 2026):** PR #38
implemented host Sandbox entitlements and sandbox-local media storage, and
PR #53 added signed-development-build verification and safe local installation.
C3.1–C3.7 are now implemented and merged; C3.8 and the **separate B1 signed
fresh-container runtime acceptance are still open**. [Apple CI #167](https://github.com/KevinCFechtel/Flux/actions/runs/38934397341)
passed on the combined `main`, but does not close B1. Finish
[MACOS_SANDBOX_ACCEPTANCE.md](MACOS_SANDBOX_ACCEPTANCE.md) **before implementing**
the Mac App Store archive/export deliverable. That later Store export is part
of R, not part of the B1 runtime sign-off.

The primary macOS distribution should likewise be the Mac App Store.

**Mac release prerequisite and approved decision:** The macOS app has **never been released**. Its host App Sandbox entitlement has been implemented but signed-app acceptance is still outstanding. The existing Developer ID/notarization path is not a Mac App Store export. Validate host Sandbox, outbound network access, actual file-dialog capabilities and App Group provisioning **before** Mac App Store archive/export scripting. The developer explicitly accepts losing all existing unsandboxed local development data on their machine. Initialize a fresh sandbox storage/credential environment: **no database/download/Keychain migration, `container-migration.plist`, legacy-location fallback or compatibility layer is required**. See B1 in [POST_REPLACEMENT_FOLLOWUP_PLAN.md](POST_REPLACEMENT_FOLLOWUP_PLAN.md).

The existing `apple/macos/Build/build-app.sh` is currently a build/validation
script, not a complete App Store distribution path.

Add macOS equivalents to the iOS archive/export flow.

The final macOS App Store path should:

- use the production Xcode configuration;
- build/archive the host app and Widget extension;
- validate the already-implemented Sandbox, outbound network/user-selected-file permissions and host/widget App Group provisioning **in the final Mac App Store-signed artifact**;
- use the correct Mac App Store distribution signing/provisioning;
- apply explicit app/extension build and marketing versions;
- validate bundle identifiers and embedded extension metadata;
- export an App Store Connect-compatible artifact accepted by Transporter;
- place the final artifact in a predictable `dist/` directory;
- perform no upload unless explicitly requested.

The desired primary flow is:

```text
local/canonical release script
→ signed macOS archive
→ validated App Store Connect export
→ Transporter/App Store Connect
→ Mac App Store
```

As on iOS, GitHub Actions may optionally build release artifacts, but the App
Store remains the primary distribution channel.

## 8. Apple script convergence

iOS and macOS should share conventions even when their Xcode export mechanics
differ.

Align at least:

- positional/flag version inputs;
- `--help` output;
- output directory conventions;
- archive naming;
- release summaries;
- validation style;
- fail-fast handling;
- no-publish-by-default behavior.

Prefer shared shell helpers only for genuinely identical logic such as version
validation or common output formatting. Do not create a large cross-platform
shell abstraction that obscures Xcode target-specific signing or entitlement
requirements.

## 9. GitHub Actions strategy

Keep CI and distribution separate.

Existing canonical Android/Apple regression workflows remain the merge gate.

Add release-oriented workflows only where they provide value:

- Android F-Droid build/publish: required;
- Android Play release artifact: optional;
- iOS App Store artifact: optional;
- macOS App Store artifact: optional.

For Android, the release candidate / GitHub promotion workflow must
depend on a verified F-Droid recipe APK from the **same commit**, and create
the final tag/GitHub Release only after this gate passes. Google Play
preparation/submission remains optional and owner-controlled; it cannot
delay an otherwise approved GitHub/F-Droid release.

### Two-repository release ownership and cutover (decision: 18 October 2026)

**Confirmed repository ownership:**

- [`KevinCFechtel/Flux`](https://github.com/KevinCFechtel/Flux)
  **remains** the development repository and hosts the release orchestration,
  release scripts, PR checks and candidate validation. Do **not** relocate
  the entire release workflow to FluxNews.
- [`KevinCFechtel/FluxNews`](https://github.com/KevinCFechtel/FluxNews)
  remains the **public product repository**: its repository identity,
  stars/watchers, issues/discussions/comments, existing releases and
  historical Flutter Git tags must be preserved. After the approved
  cutover, its root contains the native app; the current Flutter source is
  archived under `legacy/`. Flux itself also remains available.
- The final user-facing GitHub Release pages, Android download links and
  release tags belong to **FluxNews**. Running the publishing workflow
  from **Flux** is compatible with publishing into another repository;
  workflow residence and release destination are independent. The target
  repository is always passed explicitly, never assumed from
  `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`.

**Two separate stages: repository import versus release approval**

- **Migration is not a release.** First, import the native `Flux` sources
  into the existing `FluxNews` repository, archive its Flutter sources in
  `legacy/` and replace the old workflows. This produces an **import
  commit** in `FluxNews`, but must create **no release tag, GitHub Release,
  F-Droid submission or store upload**. The import can be reviewed, tested
  and merged long before the first native release.
- **Further commits are expected after the import.** Bug fixes, CI/workflow
  work, migrations, translations and release preparation may advance
  `FluxNews/main` over multiple commits. Do not assume the import commit
  is the final release commit, require a release immediately after import,
  or freeze development at that point.
- The `Flux` source commit, `FluxNews` import commit and **eventual**
  `FluxNews` release commit can all have different Git SHAs. Compare
  source/version manifests when transferring the initial snapshot, and
  record the import provenance. Later `FluxNews` commits may legitimately
  change the native tree; do **not** require it to keep matching the
  original `Flux` snapshot. For each actual release, the definitive
  provenance is the **final target `FluxNews` commit**, not an old import
  or development SHA.
- At a later owner-selected release preparation point, select an immutable
  **final candidate commit in `FluxNews`**, its committed platform versions,
  scope and release notes. The central orchestration hosted in `Flux`
  checks out and validates that **specific `FluxNews` SHA**. Only that
  candidate is eligible for release gates. Normal development CI may run
  meanwhile, but no full release-gate sequence is required after every
  ordinary post-import commit.
- All mandatory release checks, including the F-Droid recipe/source-APK
  gate for Android, must pass for the **exact SHA to be tagged in
  `FluxNews`**. Checks of a prior `Flux`, import or earlier target
  commit cannot authorize it. A later source-changing candidate commit
  requires another complete mandatory release-gate pass.
- Only on success, create platform/common release tags pointing to that
  verified **FluxNews** commit and publish exactly one corresponding
  **FluxNews** GitHub Release. Record the validated target SHA and (for
  traceability) relevant import/origin information without claiming those
  commits are identical. Combined platform tags all reference the same
  tested target commit.

**Migration and CI safety requirements:**

1. Implement and test release orchestration in `Flux` without initiating
   publications. Separately rehearse a non-destructive Flux-to-FluxNews
   import, preserving the target's existing history, releases and tag names.
2. **Replace the old Flutter workflows in FluxNews as part of the
   repository cutover**, not merely archive their source files. In
   particular, retire/replace `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml`
   (`on.push.tags: v*`) and its call to
   `submit-fdroid-signatures.yml` before any native tag is pushed.
   The replacement FluxNews workflows must coexist safely with the central
   release controller in Flux: keep routine source/PR checks as needed,
   but do not create a second release publisher, duplicate full release
   builds or trigger an automatic F-Droid submission. The old F-Droid
   process must **never** be triggered by a new `vX.Y.Z` tag.
3. Update the **native** F-Droid recipe's final `Repo` and source commit
   references for the approved publication location. The current B2
   experimental recipe points to `Flux.git` and is **not yet the final
   migrated release recipe**. Preserve historic Flutter build metadata,
   commit/tag resolvability and both allowed signing fingerprints. Audit
   official F-Droid source checkout and signing/update compatibility before
   authorizing a real submission.
4. Cross-repository writes (staging synchronization, target tag and release
   creation) require an explicit least-privilege GitHub App installation
   token or narrowly scoped fine-grained credential authorized for
   `FluxNews`; the ordinary `Flux` `GITHUB_TOKEN` must not be assumed
   to have cross-repository write rights. Separate read-only CI from
   narrowly permissioned promotion, with explicit owner approval.
5. Protect existing `FluxNews` tags and releases; reject collisions and
   use a recoverable staged promotion instead of rewriting tags or starting
   concurrent publication paths. Existing historical Flutter downloads
   remain accessible. Verify source continuity, correct store/package
   identity and matching signed update path before the first native release.
6. `Flux` remains the location of the four-scope manual release control
   (`android`, `ios`, `macos`, `all`). Google Play and Apple App Store
   uploads remain manual/owner-controlled; actual official F-Droid
   submission is separately authorized and remains prohibited during B2
   test/CI work.

**Order:** finish native/B2 technical readiness and the release
controller in Flux; transfer native sources to FluxNews and replace its old
workflows in a reviewable, non-publishing import; allow any number of later
normal development commits in FluxNews; **only when the owner elects to
release**, select and validate the final FluxNews candidate SHA through
the controller in Flux; then authorize target tags/GitHub Release. The
import itself is never an automatic release trigger. This is a documented
architecture decision, **not** an implemented repository migration,
release or publication authorization.

### Hybrid platform tags and selective CI gates (decision: 18 October 2026)

> **Approved design, not implemented.** The release orchestrator, tag creation
> and any Store/F-Droid publication remain disabled until explicitly built,
> validated and authorized. PR #67 documents the design only.

Flux is the development/orchestration repository while FluxNews retains the
public product history, tags and GitHub Releases; the release cycles for
Android, iOS/iPadOS and macOS remain independent. A manual release-candidate workflow (proposed
`workflow_dispatch`) takes `scope` (`android`, `ios`, `macos`, or
`all`), `versionName`, the **full immutable Git commit SHA**, and the
applicable platform build/version codes. Resolve these inputs up front;
never silently test the current tip of `main` instead.

| Scope | Required checks before any final tag | Final tags | GitHub Release |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `android` | Android + Rust + **mandatory F-Droid source build, scanner, APK verification** | `android/vX.Y.Z` | One Android entry |
| `ios` | iOS + Rust | `ios/vX.Y.Z` | One iOS entry |
| `macos` | macOS + Rust (including relevant Sandbox/signing checks) | `macos/vX.Y.Z` | One macOS entry |
| `all` | Android + F-Droid + iOS + macOS + **Rust once** | `android/vX.Y.Z`, `ios/vX.Y.Z`, `macos/vX.Y.Z`, `vX.Y.Z` | **One combined entry** |

Each platform may have a different public version and release date. A
combined `vX.Y.Z` release is allowed **only if all three platforms have
exactly the same approved marketing version and tested commit SHA**. Its
three platform tags and the combined tag all point to that SHA. Only
`vX.Y.Z` gets a GitHub Release entry; the additional platform tags are
provenance markers, not three more release pages. If versions or source
commits differ, publish individually. Two-platform releases remain separate
unless grouping is explicitly designed later.

**Mandatory sequence:**

1. Select the scope/version/immutable source SHA and draft platform-specific
   notes. **No final release tag and no public GitHub Release exist yet.**
2. Reuse the existing Android/iOS/macOS build/test scripts via separate
   callable gates (`workflow_call` or equivalent). Run only selected
   platforms and the Rust workspace regression tests **once per candidate**;
   do not cascade full workflows or duplicate native compilation.
3. For an `android` or `all` candidate, the F-Droid recipe lint/scanner
   and real source-built APK identity/version/ABI checks are **blocking before
   any GitHub release**. The CI APK is unsigned test evidence, not an
   installable end-user release. Signing/update compatibility (B2) must be
   approved separately before any official F-Droid submission.
4. If any mandatory check is missing, skipped, inconclusive or failed, stop
   without final tags, GitHub release, store upload or F-Droid submission.
   Correct on a branch, then rerun all required gates for the **new** SHA.
5. After every mandatory gate passes at the **same SHA**, a dedicated,
   minimally permissioned promotion job verifies that tags and release names
   do not already conflict; only then create the intended immutable tag(s)
   and **exactly one** GitHub Release with the right notes and assets.
   Never silently move an existing public tag. Partial promotion must be
   detected and recovered explicitly.
6. Apple Store exports/uploads and Google Play uploads/publication remain
   owner-controlled, independent of GitHub release timing. F-Droid submission
   is a separate explicitly authorized action; no official F-Droid release
   or submission is permitted until B2 publication acceptance and owner
   approval.

**GitHub Release presentation and downloads:**

- Clearly name the covered platform(s). A combined release has separate
  Android, iOS/iPadOS and macOS sections of release notes.
- Android may attach only a correctly **signed and verified** distributable
  APK, never the unsigned F-Droid CI test output.
- iOS/iPadOS has release notes and an App Store link, not a generic IPA
  download. macOS has notes and a Mac App Store link; an optional ZIP
  must first pass Developer ID signing, notarization and update-path review.
- GitHub's `Latest` is repository-wide, not per platform. Maintain a
  separate per-platform latest-version overview (e.g. in README).

**CI invocation and cost controls:**

- Existing PR/path-filtered Android/Apple/Rust checks remain in place for
  development. The manual candidate orchestrator reuses them selectively;
  docs-only changes must not start expensive F-Droid or Apple builds.
- Tags are created *after* the gates. Tag-push events may trigger only
  post-promotion bookkeeping, **not** the blocking checks. Multiple tags
  on a common commit must not cause repeated CI or extra Releases; do not
  depend on separate push events being emitted for every tag.
- Use candidate-scoped concurrency and cancellation, with artifacts tied to
  commit SHA/scope/version. Do not launch duplicate Rust or F-Droid builds.
  Only the final publisher needs `contents: write`; ordinary checks
  remain read-only and hold no store publishing credentials.

**Still to implement:** reusable platform-specific CI jobs; candidate
input and SHA validation; the F-Droid prerequisite for Android-bearing
releases; deterministic, idempotent multi-tag/single-release promotion;
and negative tests for failed/skipped gates, mismatched SHA/version,
existing tags and duplicate triggers. This document changes no CI behavior.

Release workflows should generally be manual or release/tag-driven and should:

- call the same canonical scripts used locally;
- surface artifacts for inspection when appropriate;
- use environment/secret protection for signing credentials;
- never publish from arbitrary pull requests;
- never silently derive a production signing identity from development config.

## 10. Implementation order

Implement in this order:

1. **Define common version/CLI conventions.**
   Document exact argument names and artifact paths before changing platform
   scripts.

2. **Normalize Android Play preparation.**
   Wrap the existing production AAB flow without changing its signing model.

3. **Validate F-Droid build/scanner feasibility, then implement native preparation.**
   Complete B2 in `POST_REPLACEMENT_FOLLOWUP_PLAN.md` first. Port only the still-
   required metadata/signing/reproducibility behavior from the old Flutter repository.

4. **Add Android F-Droid build/publish GitHub Action.**
   Make it call the canonical scripts and validate update compatibility before
   retiring old Flutter distribution automation.

5. **Normalize iOS archive/export.**
   Convert the existing archive + App Store Connect export path to the shared
   release interface and rename TestFlight-specific naming where appropriate.

6. **Enable and validate the macOS sandbox, then add macOS archive/export.**
   Complete B1 in `POST_REPLACEMENT_FOLLOWUP_PLAN.md` first, with fresh developer
   data (no migration), and only then create the missing App Store Connect/
   Transporter path with proper Mac App Store signing and entitlement validation.

7. **Optionally add Apple release-artifact workflows.**
   Only after local scripts are authoritative and stable.

8. **Final release smoke/documentation pass.**
   Verify `--help`, versioning, paths, signing failure modes and produced
   artifacts for all four targets: Play, F-Droid, iOS App Store and macOS App
   Store.

## 11. Definition of done

This release-scripting follow-up is complete when:

- one documented top-level interface can prepare each supported distribution
  target;
- Android Play AAB preparation is deterministic and versioned;
- the manual release entry point selects `android`, `ios`, `macos` or `all` gates by immutable candidate SHA, running shared Rust checks only once;
- platform tags produce their independent release pages, while all-platform releases create a common tag and exactly one combined GitHub Release;
- release orchestration remains in `Flux`; target repository `FluxNews` retains its history, public tags and GitHub Releases, with both source/target SHA provenance and final gates on the actual FluxNews candidate;
- every Android GitHub Release is blocked until the F-Droid metadata/scanner/real-APK build and shared mandatory checks pass for the exact candidate SHA;
- a failed release candidate cannot create a final tag or GitHub Release, and fixes are retested at a new SHA;
- the F-Droid-style source build and scanner feasibility checks pass before publishing is automated;
- Android has a native F-Droid build/publish workflow in this repository;
- F-Droid update compatibility over the existing Flutter-distributed app is
  validated;
- iOS can produce a validated production App Store Connect IPA for Transporter;
- the previously unreleased macOS app passes a fresh-install sandbox acceptance without migrating local development data;
- macOS can produce a validated Mac App Store Connect artifact for Transporter;
- Apple host apps and extensions are version/signing/entitlement checked;
- optional CI artifact jobs delegate to the same local scripts;
- no production release path publishes implicitly;
- the primary Apple release path remains App Store Connect/Transporter;
- replacement/product implementation remains untouched.

## 12. Non-goals

This follow-up does not:

- change application functionality;
- reopen migration logic;
- change Core/UniFFI architecture;
- replace Play/App Store/F-Droid with GitHub Releases;
- require fully automatic store publication;
- move production secrets into the repository;
- make CI-produced artifacts the authoritative release source when the canonical
  local script produced and validated the final signed store artifact.

## R2 macOS App Store export implementation (17 October 2026)

`bash Build/release.sh macos --target appstore --version-code N --version-name V` invokes `apple/macos/Build/archive.sh` and `export-appstore.sh`. The archive uses the Release configuration, explicit host/widget version settings, automatic provisioning and Apple Distribution signing; `verify-sandbox.sh ... distribution` checks the signed host/widget bundle IDs, version parity, Sandbox and App Group entitlements, signature chain and Apple Distribution team. Export uses Xcode's App Store Connect export method, expects a non-empty `.pkg` in `dist/macos/appstore/`, and never uploads automatically.

**Not yet accepted:** This flow has not been exercised with the owner's Apple Distribution certificates/profiles or Transporter. Xcode/macOS export compatibility, provisioning, App Group and embedded Rust library signing must be validated on the owner's Mac before calling R2 complete. Store signing credentials must remain outside Git.

## R1 version argument parity

The central `Build/release.sh` accepts `--version-code` and `--version-name` for normal and store builds on Android, iOS and macOS. For Apple, `--version-code` maps to `CFBundleVersion` / `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` and `--version-name` to `CFBundleShortVersionString` / `MARKETING_VERSION`. Normal builds may omit both and use the project values; store release targets require both. The macOS direct build script accepts `--build-number N --version-name V` and passes both to Xcode, affecting app and widget targets. The iOS direct build and archive scripts already support equivalent version inputs; export scripts inherit the archived version. This is a CLI contract change, not a claim of device/store acceptance.

## macOS local installation default

`apple/macos/Build/install-local.sh` now defaults to strict `developer-id` verification, requiring a Developer ID Application signed host, widget and embedded Rust library with matching team, Sandbox and App Group entitlements. By default, the newest Developer ID ZIP in `dist/macos/developer-id/` is extracted and installed. Set `SOURCE_APP=/path/to/FluxNews.app` to select an unpackaged app explicitly. For deliberate development-only installs, `INSTALL_MODE=development` opts into the prior Apple Development/provisioning verification. Note that the ordinary `macos` build and App Store archive do **not** produce a Developer ID signed app: use `apple/macos/Build/release-developer-id.sh` (Developer ID signing/notarization pipeline) before the default local installation. The Developer ID release pipeline still has its own environment/signing prerequisites.

## R cleanup: distribution entry points

The former iOS `export-testflight.sh` has been replaced by `apple/ios/Build/export-appstore.sh`; the former macOS `release.sh` is now `apple/macos/Build/release-developer-id.sh`. Both former files have been deleted. The central `Build/release.sh` delegates to these named distribution scripts; for a notarized Developer ID ZIP run `bash Build/release.sh macos --target developer-id [--version-code N --version-name V]`. The Developer ID script accepts explicit version overrides, and its output is `dist/macos/developer-id/`; the newest notarized ZIP in `dist/macos/developer-id/` is the default source for `install-local.sh`. App Store and Developer ID are distinct signing/distribution channels. External automation using the old paths must be updated.

The cleanup is not a claim of release acceptance: validate CI and run the Apple signing/notarization/export workflows on the owner's Mac before merging.

## macOS distribution artifact layout

The macOS unpackaged app and both distribution artifacts live under `dist/macos/`:

- `dist/macos/FluxNews.app`: unpackaged app from macOS build; the Developer ID release signs and notarizes this app.

- `dist/macos/appstore/*.pkg`: Mac App Store Connect package for Transporter (unchanged).
- `dist/macos/developer-id/FluxNews-<version>-macos-<architecture>.zip`: notarized Developer ID ZIP (moved from `dist/release/`).

By default `install-local.sh` extracts the newest Developer ID ZIP from `dist/macos/developer-id/` and installs its verified app; `SOURCE_APP` can still select an unpackaged app explicitly; existing ZIP files in the legacy `dist/release/` directory and the former `dist/FluxNews.app` are not automatically moved or removed. Re-run the Developer ID release to create an artifact in the new directory.
