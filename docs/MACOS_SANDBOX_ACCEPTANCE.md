# macOS App Sandbox — B1 implementation and acceptance

**Status (16 October 2026): B1 code implemented; signed fresh-container
runtime acceptance OPEN.** The macOS app has **not been released**. The developer
has explicitly accepted losing existing local macOS development data when the
app switches to sandboxed storage. There is **no migration or compatibility path**.

## Implemented in `main` (PR #38 and PR #53)

- Host entitlements: `com.apple.security.app-sandbox`, `com.apple.security.network.client`, `com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write`, and the existing `group.dev.kevincfechtel.fluxNews` App Group.
- Widget entitlements remain separate and keep their existing sandbox and App Group.
- Internal podcast downloads are now under sandbox-local `Application Support/FluxNews/Media` instead of `~/Movies/FluxNews`. The existing `BrowserStore` persistent/core cache locations resolve under the app container when sandboxed.
- `apple/macos/Build/build-app.sh` now verifies that the signed host has the new entitlements rather than asserting that the host is unsandboxed.
- XCTest checks verify source entitlements and that the derived media path uses Application Support.
- PR [#53](https://github.com/KevinCFechtel/Flux/pull/53) added
  `apple/macos/Build/verify-sandbox.sh`, enforcing signed host/widget versions,
  bundle IDs, App Group/provisioning, Apple Development team and effective signed
  Sandbox/file/network entitlements.
- `build-app.sh` uses Apple Development signing for the real verification path;
  `install-local.sh` validates both source and staged application before
  replacing the local app, without deleting persistent data.
- [Apple CI #164](https://github.com/KevinCFechtel/Flux/actions/runs/38924332033)
  passed for PR #53; combined `main`
  [Apple CI #167](https://github.com/KevinCFechtel/Flux/actions/runs/38934397341)
  also passed. Neither constitutes an on-Mac acceptance run.

## Not implemented

No old data, Keychain, download or account migration. The existing Developer ID/notarization script remains separate from the future Mac App Store export script. No claim of successful App Store provisioning or review is made.

## Decision history — signed acceptance deferred on 12 October 2026

The owner previously **deferred signed, real-device Sandbox acceptance** until
after feature-parity implementation. That work (C3.1–C3.7) has since merged.
PRs #38 and #53 establish source, signature and installation checks, but do
**not** prove that a provisioned/signed app can start, access Keychain and the
App Group, sync, play, download or export/import backups. B1 is **now the next
real-Mac acceptance gate**, not waived or already passed.

C3.8 functional acceptance may use the same signed test installation, but
each phase must have its own pass/fail evidence.
Before any Mac App Store production export, submission or release-readiness
claim, complete and record the signed-app checklist below. No migration from
the unreleased, unsandboxed macOS development app is required.

## Required device and signed-app acceptance (open)

1. Sign the app with an actual development/distribution profile supporting its host+widget App Group. Inspect **signed** entitlements, not only XML sources.
2. Start with a fresh sandbox container and fresh account credentials. Confirm that Core database and caches persist across relaunch.
3. Verify sync, image/media networking, remote podcast playback, downloaded podcast playback, and the Listening List with local file access.
4. Verify Settings backup import/export via `NSOpenPanel` and `NSSavePanel`, including read/write permissions and actual encrypted backup round-trip.
5. Verify WidgetKit snapshots and the App Group across app/widget process boundaries.
6. Verify Keychain save/load after relaunch, periodic sync, menu bar controls, login-item registration and media remote controls.
7. Test existing Developer ID packaging separately if it is retained; implement and validate the Mac App Store archive/Transporter path only after acceptance.
8. Keep a record of sandbox-denial logs and resolve actual missing capabilities without granting broad filesystem access.

CI compilation and source-plist tests alone **do not prove** end-to-end sandbox behavior.

**Gate separation:** Sign off **B1** after a signed development build passes
the fresh-container runtime checklist and relevant denials are resolved.
Mac App Store provisioning, archive/export and Transporter validation are a
**subsequent R deliverable**, not an unfulfilled condition inside B1.
The existing Developer ID/notarization script is also separate.

## B1 signed macOS development build acceptance

On a Mac with Apple Development signing and App Groups provisioned for both targets:

```bash
CONFIGURATION=Debug DEVELOPMENT_SIGNING=1 ./apple/macos/Build/build-app.sh
./apple/macos/Build/verify-sandbox.sh ./dist/FluxNews.app development
./apple/macos/Build/install-local.sh
```

The verifier checks actual signatures, host/widget IDs and versions, Sandbox and App Group entitlements, signing team and embedded development provisioning. The installer validates both source and staged copy **before** replacing the application; no app container or Keychain data is deleted. A truly fresh-container test requires a clean macOS user or separately approved manual cleanup. Run all runtime checklist steps before marking B1 accepted. Unsigned CI checks do not establish signed Sandbox acceptance. Developer ID and Mac App Store distribution remain separate.
