# iOS D7 — Now Playing, Remote Commands, and CarPlay

> **Status: CONTRACT / IMPLEMENTATION NOT STARTED**
>
> Repository-first audit baseline: `main` at `8931fb2fff8284ef82f38b53634f8d2e699fa7d7` (25 September 2026).
> `docs/PHASE_D_NATIVE_IOS_IPADOS.md` remains the authoritative Phase-D contract. This document narrows D7 without changing the frozen Phase A/B/C, D5, or UIKit Timeline contracts. D6 remains implementation-stable/testvalidated with its real-device UX observation window open.

## 1. Audit result

D7 can be implemented without a Rust/Core change and without changing the D6 playback architecture.

The current iOS ownership chain is already the required foundation:

```text
IOSAppRuntime
  -> IOSMediaRuntime                         app-scoped media owner
       -> IOSMediaPlaybackCoordinator        sole playback orchestrator
            -> IOSAVPlayerPlaybackEngine     sole native AVPlayer owner
            -> IOSMediaAudioSessionCoordinator
            -> IOSMediaPlaybackCoreAccess    narrow Core adapter
       -> IOSMediaPlaybackPresentationState  sole live playback projection
       -> IOSMediaTransferCoordinator
```

`IOSMediaPlaybackPresentationState` already projects the stable D7 inputs: loaded enclosure, feed title, media title, artwork source, chapters, status, position, duration, local/remote source, loading/buffering/error state, and playback rate. D7 must consume this state; it must not create another durable or independently mutable playback model.

The coordinator already owns prepare/play/resume, pause, stop, seek/skip, rate, completion/restart, artwork loading, checkpointing, Core lifecycle suspension/replacement, post-sync reconciliation, interruption/route behavior, and AVAudioSession activation/deactivation. D7 commands must dispatch into this coordinator rather than operate on AVPlayer directly.

The Core already exposes the read models needed for D7 browsing and playback: Listening List/feeds, `prepare_playback`, playback state, chapters, artwork, checkpoint/completion/restart and download/local-media resolution. Rust remains durable authority. No direct SQLite or Miniflux access is permitted in D7.

## 2. Proven Phase-C reuse

macOS `MediaRemoteControlCoordinator.swift` is a strong semantic reference. It already contains:

- `NowPlayingProjection` with normalized title/source title, duration, bounded elapsed time, effective/default rate, playback state, asset URL, and artwork bytes;
- fallback artwork behavior;
- `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` publication;
- `MPRemoteCommandCenter` registration for play, pause, toggle, ±30-second skip, and absolute seek;
- explicit disabling of next/previous track and stop;
- artwork generation guards against stale async completion;
- fast elapsed-time publication separate from full metadata publication;
- cleanup of command targets and Now Playing state.

The semantic projection and command vocabulary are genuine Apple-platform reuse candidates. The concrete macOS coordinator is not copied wholesale because image types, runtime ownership/lifecycle, playback-coordinator types, and CarPlay are platform-specific.

### Shared extraction rule

D7-A should extract only platform-neutral Apple media semantics to `apple/shared/FluxApple`, for example:

- `AppleNowPlayingProjection` (or equivalent name);
- normalized duration/elapsed/rate/state rules;
- `AppleMediaRemoteCommand` semantic command enum;
- shared skip interval policy (currently 30 seconds).

Do **not** move `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter`, `MPRemoteCommandCenter`, `MPMediaItemArtwork`, AppKit/UIKit image construction, AVAudioSession, CarPlay scenes/templates, or app-runtime ownership into shared code. The shared layer remains a projection/policy layer, not a state owner.

## 3. Current D7 gaps

There is currently no iOS `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` adapter, no iOS `MPRemoteCommandCenter` adapter, and no CarPlay implementation. D6 intentionally left all three to D7.

The native development entitlement currently contains only the native-dev App Group. The upgrade-test entitlement already carries `com.apple.developer.carplay-audio`, matching the historical production identity. D7 therefore needs a deliberate signing/capability plan for a CarPlay-testable development identity; entitlement availability must be verified in the actual signed build/profile and must not be assumed merely from a source `.entitlements` file.

The current iOS `Info.plist` declares background `audio`/`fetch` and a scene manifest with `UIApplicationSupportsMultipleScenes = false`, but no CarPlay scene configuration. Modern CarPlay audio UI must use the CarPlay framework/template scene path. `MPPlayableContentManager`/`MPPlayableContentDelegate` are deprecated and must not become the new architecture.

CarPlay introduces an important lifecycle distinction: the phone UI remains intentionally single-scene, while CarPlay requires a `CPTemplateApplicationScene`. Adding the CarPlay scene must not be interpreted as enabling a second independent Flux application/Core/media runtime. The CarPlay scene is a platform presentation endpoint attached to `IOSAppRuntime.shared.mediaRuntime`.

## 4. Ownership and lifecycle decisions

### Playback authority

There remains exactly one `IOSMediaPlaybackCoordinator`, one native AVPlayer engine, one AVAudioSession coordinator, and one `IOSMediaPlaybackPresentationState` per app runtime. Lock Screen, Control Center, headset controls, and CarPlay all observe/command that same runtime.

### Now Playing ownership

Add one app-scoped iOS Now Playing/remote-command adapter as a child of `IOSMediaRuntime`. It observes `playbackPresentationState`, publishes system metadata, loads artwork through the existing playback coordinator/Core adapter, and sends semantic commands back to `playbackCoordinator`.

It must exist independently of whether `IOSMediaPlayerView`, Listening List, or any other SwiftUI surface is currently presented. D6 presentation polish therefore cannot break D7.

### Command semantics

Initial supported commands:

- Play: play/resume the currently loaded enclosure through `IOSMediaPlaybackCoordinator`.
- Pause: coordinator pause; checkpoint semantics remain D6-owned.
- Toggle: play/pause based on the shared live presentation status.
- Skip backward/forward: coordinator skip, initially using the proven 30-second policy unless an existing product setting is discovered before implementation.
- Change playback position: validate/bound seconds and dispatch coordinator seek.

`stopCommand` stays disabled initially. D6 Stop is a meaningful in-app lifecycle operation (checkpoint + retain resumable medium + release audio session), but exposing Stop as a general remote command is not required for standard spoken-audio control and would create a different external semantic from Pause. `nextTrackCommand`/`previousTrackCommand` also stay disabled until Flux has an explicit queue/episode-advance contract; D7 must not invent one.

Restart remains an explicit Flux completion action, not a generic remote command. Natural completion continues through the existing D6 completion path.

### Publication lifecycle

When no enclosure is loaded, clear Now Playing info and use unknown playback state. When media is loaded but paused/stopped, retain metadata and elapsed position so external surfaces can resume the same item. While playing, publish the configured playback rate; while not playing, effective rate is zero while the default/configured rate remains available.

Position ticks may update elapsed/rate without rebuilding artwork and all metadata. Metadata/artwork updates use generation/identity guards so an old artwork request cannot overwrite a newer enclosure.

### CarPlay ownership

Add a CarPlay scene delegate/coordinator that owns only CarPlay presentation objects (`CPInterfaceController`, templates, short-lived browsing projection/tasks). It references the app-scoped media runtime and a narrow Core-backed browsing adapter. It never owns AVPlayer, AVAudioSession, playback checkpoints, download state, SQLite, or a second playback presentation state.

Disconnecting CarPlay destroys CarPlay UI state only. Playback may continue through the app-scoped runtime according to existing D6 semantics.

## 5. CarPlay API contract

For the current iOS 17+ deployment target, use the CarPlay framework scene/template APIs:

- `CPTemplateApplicationScene` / `CPTemplateApplicationSceneDelegate`;
- `CPInterfaceController`;
- `CPListTemplate` (and only additional audio-entitlement-compatible templates if justified by implementation);
- shared `CPNowPlayingTemplate` for current playback.

The CarPlay scene configuration must be added under `CPTemplateApplicationSceneSessionRoleApplication` in the scene manifest and must set a root template during the CarPlay connection callback. The existing phone-scene single-scene policy remains conceptually intact: CarPlay is a dedicated external presentation scene, not a second phone/Core session.

Audio-entitled CarPlay apps are restricted to the templates Apple permits for that entitlement. Do not use `CPInformationTemplate` for the audio app. Use selection handlers on modern selectable list items rather than the deprecated list-template delegate selection API.

`com.apple.developer.carplay-audio` is required. D7 implementation/acceptance must verify the development and production/upgrade-test signing profiles actually contain the entitlement. Simulator UI testing is useful but does not replace signed physical-device/head-unit acceptance.

## 6. CarPlay browsing model

The initial D7 browsing source is the Core-backed Listening List, not a scan of downloaded files and not the legacy Flutter cache. This intentionally modernizes the legacy behavior while preserving its user goal.

Minimum browse behavior:

1. root presents playable Listening List content;
2. optional feed grouping/filtering may use existing `listening_list_feeds()` when it improves navigation without duplicating state;
3. each row is projected from `ListeningListItem` / its selected playable audio enclosure;
4. selecting a playable item dispatches prepare/play to the existing `IOSMediaPlaybackCoordinator`;
5. once playback is ready/started, present the shared `CPNowPlayingTemplate`;
6. remote/CarPlay transport controls operate through the same remote-command/playback coordinator path and same Now Playing publication.

Downloaded and remote media are both valid because D6 `preparePlayback` already resolves the appropriate source. CarPlay must not require a local download unless a later explicit product policy says otherwise.

If an item has multiple audio enclosures and Core/UI semantics cannot select one unambiguously, CarPlay must expose a deterministic secondary choice or mark the row non-playable; it must not guess a different enclosure than the existing Listening List semantics.

## 7. D7 implementation phases

### D7-0 — Contract and ownership audit — COMPLETE

This document is the output. No productive playback code changes are part of D7-0.

Acceptance:

- repository/current docs audited;
- Apple API/entitlement direction verified;
- ownership frozen before implementation;
- no Core change justified.

### D7-A — Shared Apple media projection

Extract the proven semantic subset from macOS into `apple/shared/FluxApple` and migrate macOS to it without behavior change. Add focused shared tests for fallback titles, duration/elapsed bounding, rates, stopped/paused/playing projection, invalid URLs, and error behavior.

Gate: macOS tests remain green before iOS consumes the projection.

### D7-B — iOS Now Playing adapter

Add the app-scoped iOS adapter under `IOSMediaRuntime`; publish title, feed/podcast, duration, elapsed time, effective/default rate, asset URL where valid, playback state, and artwork. Reuse existing artwork/Core access; no UI dependency.

Gate: unit tests with injected/fake Now Playing sink plus existing iOS suite/build.

### D7-C — iOS Remote Commands

Register play/pause/toggle/skip/seek once, route only to the existing playback coordinator, remove registrations on cleanup, and explicitly disable unsupported stop/next/previous commands.

Gate: command dispatch/status tests, duplicate-registration test, no-loaded-item failures, seek bounds, and lifecycle cleanup.

### D7-D — System playback lifecycle and real-device Now Playing acceptance

Validate lock screen, Control Center, headset/Bluetooth commands, background audio, interruptions, route changes, rate/elapsed publication, artwork replacement, pause/resume, Stop-from-app followed by remote Play, natural completion, and cross-device reconciliation while paused versus actively playing.

This phase is deliberately before CarPlay so the common OS media contract is stable first.

### D7-E — CarPlay scene, entitlement, and browsing

Add the CarPlay scene manifest/configuration, scene delegate/coordinator, development signing strategy, Core-backed Listening List browser, feed navigation if retained, selection, loading/error/empty states, and bounded template item counts according to CarPlay APIs.

Gate: CarPlay Simulator browse/navigation tests plus source-level/unit tests for browsing projection and selection identity.

### D7-F — CarPlay playback integration

Connect CarPlay selection to the existing playback coordinator, present `CPNowPlayingTemplate`, and verify transport controls/current playback are the same state as phone/lock-screen playback. No CarPlay-specific player or queue.

Gate: switching control between phone UI, lock screen/Control Center, and CarPlay never creates divergent state or duplicate playback.

### D7-G — Integration and real-device acceptance

Run full Rust/native test gates and physical-device CarPlay acceptance. D7 closes only when Now Playing/remote commands and CarPlay pass the acceptance matrix below.

## 8. Automated test plan

Required focused coverage:

- shared Now Playing projection normalization and bounds;
- iOS publication with/without media, duration, artwork, errors, paused/stopped/playing states and non-1x rates;
- stale artwork completion cannot replace current artwork;
- elapsed-only update does not recreate unrelated metadata/artwork;
- remote play/pause/toggle/±skip/seek route to the one coordinator;
- unsupported commands are disabled;
- registration is idempotent and cleanup removes targets;
- media runtime attach/detach/Core replacement does not create a second adapter/player;
- CarPlay browse projection uses Core Listening List identity;
- feed filtering and multi-enclosure selection are deterministic;
- CarPlay selection calls the shared playback coordinator and never constructs a playback engine;
- CarPlay connect/disconnect owns templates only and does not stop/detach playback;
- scene-manifest and entitlement configuration have source-level regression coverage where practical.

Repository gates after each meaningful package:

- existing Rust workspace/Core tests;
- existing native iOS test script and app build;
- affected macOS tests/build when shared Apple code changes;
- `git diff --check`.

## 9. Real-device acceptance matrix

D7 requires evidence for at least:

- iPhone, app foreground: metadata/artwork/position/rate correct;
- iPhone locked/background: audio continues and lock-screen controls work;
- Control Center: play/pause/skip/seek update the in-app state correctly;
- Bluetooth/headset route: remote play/pause and route-loss behavior preserve D6 semantics;
- app Stop: audio session is released; later supported Play resumes the prepared item correctly;
- natural completion and Restart remain correct after Now Playing integration;
- local downloaded media and remote streaming both publish/control correctly;
- sync reconciliation does not seek an actively playing item and can update paused/stopped progress as already specified by D6;
- CarPlay connect while idle, while paused, and while already playing;
- browse Listening List and optional feed grouping;
- select remote and downloaded items;
- CarPlay play/pause/skip and current playback presentation;
- disconnect/reconnect CarPlay without duplicate commands, duplicate AVPlayer, or playback loss;
- production/upgrade-test signed build carries the CarPlay audio entitlement;
- at least one physical CarPlay/head-unit or Apple-supported equivalent real-device path, not Simulator-only evidence.

## 10. Risks and mitigations

### CarPlay entitlement/provisioning — high external risk

Source configuration alone cannot grant CarPlay. Apple entitlement approval and the actual provisioning profile are release dependencies. Mitigation: verify signing early in D7-E, before polishing templates.

### Scene ownership — medium architectural risk

The current app intentionally disables multiple phone scenes. CarPlay adds a dedicated scene role. Mitigation: keep `IOSAppRuntime.shared`/`IOSMediaRuntime` process-scoped and make the CarPlay scene a presentation-only client. Do not instantiate Core/runtime from the CarPlay delegate.

### Duplicate remote registrations — medium runtime risk

Repeated coordinator creation can cause commands to fire multiple times. Mitigation: one adapter owned by `IOSMediaRuntime`, idempotent registration, explicit cleanup, and tests.

### Now Playing update churn — low/medium performance risk

The AVPlayer position callback is currently 0.5 s. Rebuilding artwork/metadata at that cadence is unnecessary. Mitigation: separate elapsed/rate publication from full metadata/artwork publication, following the proven macOS design.

### Artwork races — medium correctness risk

Artwork is asynchronous and the loaded enclosure may change. Mitigation: source/enclosure generation guards before publication.

### D6 UX observation overlap — low risk if boundary is respected

D7 must never observe SwiftUI geometry or button placement. Its only inputs are the app-scoped playback presentation state, playback coordinator, Core-backed browse read models, and stable runtime lifecycle. Player/Listening-List visual polish can therefore continue independently.

### Queue semantics — deliberate non-goal

D7 does not invent next/previous episode behavior, autoplay, Up Next, or a durable queue. These require a separate product/domain contract. `CPNowPlayingTemplate` is used for current playback without claiming queue semantics that Flux does not have.

## 11. D7 completion contract

D7 is complete when:

- iOS Now Playing and remote commands are app-scoped adapters over the D6 runtime;
- macOS/iOS share only the proven semantic projection/policy layer;
- CarPlay browses Core-backed playable content and starts the same D6 playback stack;
- no second player, durable Swift media state, SQLite/Miniflux path, or duplicate orchestration exists;
- unsupported Stop/next/previous semantics have not been invented;
- automated Rust/iOS/macOS gates are green;
- lock-screen/Control Center/background and physical CarPlay acceptance are recorded;
- D6 presentation can still evolve without changes to D7 architecture.

Only after those gates should D7 be marked complete/architecture-frozen in the Phase-D contract.
