/**
 * E1-C public/system CA gate.
 *
 * This is the one E1-C gate that needs outbound internet access, so it is a deliberate online
 * integration test and is not part of the offline host gate `android/Build/test.sh`.
 *
 * The proof is a semantic one rather than "some error was thrown": the Core maps a failed
 * transport to [AccountValidationException.Network] and only maps an actually received HTTP
 * response to an HTTP-level outcome. Reaching an HTTP-level outcome against a public host is
 * therefore evidence that the Android platform verifier accepted a public/system trust anchor.
